# Station-Updates
A project to run station departure boards on Twitter

Each station has a folder. Inside each is:
 - a tweeting v2.py file containing the code to get the data from the National Rail Darwin API and turn it into tweets.
 - an auth.txt file (not included in this repositry) with the api keys to access the Twitter and National Rail Darwin APIs
